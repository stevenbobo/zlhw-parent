/**
 * maintains contextual information for a thread in a set of
 * {@link Context}s.
 * 
 * <h3>Introduction</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Objects have different lifecycles and different context's (aka scopes).  An 
 * environment provides the structure to easily manage objects with different 
 * contexts.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Examples of contexts are: 
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>process-engine</b>: The process-engine context is used to store e.g. data sources,
 *     session factories and other static resources needed by an application.
 *     The process-engine context lives for the complete duration of the {@link EnvironmentFactory}.  
 *     So if the {@link EnvironmentFactory} is maintained in a static member field, the 
 *     process-engine context lives for the duration of the application.
 *     The same process-engine context is shared for all the Environments produced by one 
 *     EnvironmentFactory.</li>
 *   <li><b>environment</b>: The environment context is used for e.g. a transaction 
 *     and transactional resources, user authentication.  This results in an efficient and 
 *     configurable use of transactional resources that need to be lazily initialized.</li>
 *   <li>The environment can accomodate other contexts as well.  They can be added 
 *     and removed dynamically.  Examples of other potential contexts are web-request, web-session, 
 *     web-application, business processDefinition, jobImpl, ... </li>
 * </ul>    
 *      
 * <center><img src="environment.gif"/></center>
 * 
 * <p>An environment is typically installed like this
 * </p>
 * 
 * <b><pre>static EnvironmentFactory environmentFactory = new DefaultEnvironmentFactory();
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * EnvironmentImpl environment = environmentFactory.openEnvironment();
 * try {
 * 
 *   ... everything available in this block ... 
 * 
 * } finally {
 *   environment.close();
 * }
 * </pre></b>
 *
 * <h3>Purpose</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The first purpose of the environment is to separate the application from the 
 * environment.  Standard Java and Enterprise Java are quite different and an environment 
 * abstraction like this allows for the development of applications that can run in 
 * both Standard and Enterprise environments.  Also test environments are easier to 
 * tweak this way. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>A second purpose of the environment is to enable specific to global searching 
 * of resources.  E.g. you could search for an 'adminEmailAddress' in the contexts
 * 'execution', 'transaction' and 'process-engine' in the given order.
 * That way, a global adminEmailAddress can be specified in the process-engine context 
 * and it can be refined in more specific contexts.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Search order</h3>
 * 
 * <p>To find an object in the environment, a searchOrder can be specified.  A 
 * search order is an sequence that specifies the order in which the contexts should
 * be searched.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>The default search order is the inverse sequence of how the contexts are 
 * added to the environment.  This is because in general, we can assume that the 
 * more recent a context was added, the more specific it is. 
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Transaction, username and classloader</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Three objects are used so frequently in an environment that they get 
 * special treatment:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Transaction</b>: an abstraction for marking a transaction with 
 *   setRollbackOnly.</li>
 *   <li><b>Classloader</b>: the current class loader.</li>
 *   <li><b>Username</b>: the name of the currently authenticated user.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>For these special properties, setters are also available.  That is to support 
 * programmatic injection into the environment.  Alternatively, they can be configured
 * in one of the contexts. 
 * </p>
